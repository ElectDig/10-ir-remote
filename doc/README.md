#   Project 10-ir-remote

  Electronica Digital - Austral 2023 - EAM

##  Connecting an IR remote control to an ESP32

  Using ESP32 development board

### Hardware

  1 KY-022 Infrared receiver module
  Jumper wires

 For KY-022 datasheet, please refer to following Web page:

 [Keyes Infrared Receiver Module](http://eprints.polsri.ac.id/4641/12/Keyes%20-%20Infrared%20Receiver%20Module%20.pdf)

### Software

  Uses library _IRremoteESP8266_

###  Connections

  Connect KY-022 GND to GND
  Connect KY-022 VCC to 3.3 V
  Connect KY-022 Out to GPIO "IR_RCV"

###  Code comments

  The code, that resides in folder _src_ has a main file, named _ir_main.cpp_, and three other files.
  Those other files are related to conversion from IR code to key result. 
  In order to do that, which is dependent of the remote control, the conversion table is in the file _ir_convert.def_; in file _ir_convert.cpp_ is the code of function named _ir_convert_ that is used in _ir_main.cpp. In tha sense, in _ir_convert.h_ is there the prototype of the same function, so is recognized in _ir_main.cpp_

  In main file, there is the evaluation of the macro _IN_TEST_ which is defined in _platformio.ini_; when this macro is **1**, program is used to note all the codes generated by an specific remote control.
  After that, the conversion table is filled and then, macro is changed to **0** and  the program is compiled so that the remote control is used
    

###  Links

  Here is the link to the library used; it is a very complete library, used originally for ESP8266 and extended to ESP32; it has plenty of examples to use; please, go to the examples folder to see them all. The code used in this project was taken from example _IRecvDemo_
